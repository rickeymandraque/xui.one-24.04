If I have time, I will look at the other versions... but nothing is certain !


[Changelog](./Changelog.md) 

## TL;DR :
I am completely reworking the installation because it poses extremely high security risks.

A service, whatever it is, should never be run from `/home` especially with extremely high rights !

I now understand why so many IPTV servers are compromised and the leak of tens of thousands of accounts per day on the net.
